    //? Number System 
   //* Number system is the system to represent the quantity of objects or data with the help of digits or numbers.  

   //* In Number System there was different type of systems but we are mainly focus on two first was Decimal Number System and Binary Number System.  

   //? Decimal Number System : 
   //* 1st. Decimal Number System having base 10 it means total number of symbols "digits" a number system is used. 
   //* 2nd. It uses digits 0 to 9 and with the help of combinations of this digits we can generate or create our number example 1, 22, 34, 89, 500 
   
   
   //? Binary Number System : 
   //* 1st. Binary Number System having base 2 it means total number of symbol this number system is used was 2. 
   //* 2nd. Binary Number System have only two values 0 and 1. 
   //* 3rd. Data types in our program and data inside the computer are stored in binary form only. As we know, a computer is an electronic device and it has circuits inside it. When the circuit is OFF, it is represented by 0, and when the circuit is ON, it is represented by 1. Thatâ€™s why all data is stored in the form of binary (0s and 1s).
