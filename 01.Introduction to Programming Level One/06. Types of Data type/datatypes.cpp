//? In programming language our datatypes are mainly categorized in two types but in c++ there was categorized in three type

//* 1st. Primitive Data Types
// Primitive data types are also called in-built data types because they are predefined by the programming language.
// These data types are used to store simple values such as numbers and characters.
// Examples: int, char, float, bool, double, long, etc.

//* 2nd. Non-Primitive Data Types
// Non-primitive data types are also called derived data types because they are derived from primitive types.
// These types are used to store more complex data structures in a program.
// Examples: arrays, pointers, strings, etc.

//* 3rd. User-defined Data Types
// C++ also allows the creation of user-defined data types, which can be used to represent more complex data.
// These are created by the programmer as per the programâ€™s requirements.
// Examples: structures (struct), unions (union), classes (class), enumerations (enum), etc. 


//! Datatypes give us two most important information : 
//* 1st. Type of  data we stored it. 
//* 2nd. Size of memory taken by our datatypes.
